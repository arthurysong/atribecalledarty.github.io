Hey,
Today I enrolled in Flat Iron self paced Web Development Program and just got done with a couple lessons and labs and I think I might be done for today. I saw there was a blog section in the header and decided to just give it a try.

I like to journal on my own but I've never really shared much of what I've wrote, so I think this might be a good experience for me. I can share with other people what my journey into coding has been like and also I can keep progress.

Earlier today, I was ruminating whether to go with FlatIron or Bloc. I was originally just planning on going with FlatIron, I hadn't looked into much other schools, but I was really happy with FlatIron's outcomes report, the cost, and the teaching style in the online. (I went through some of Lambda school's precourse work and it was a lot of watching long videos, and I couldn't stand sitting there. I think I much rather prefer being able to read through content and being able to skip over what I already know and also I think reading is just better for me.) So yeah, I was planning on going with FlatIron, but just in case I didn't get admitted or there were better programs I decided to look into some other schools. One other online program (I was only interested in attending online programs, as I'm working full-time and live in very remote Tucson, AZ) that I was seriously considering was Bloc. Their tuition was the same, but they only offer an online program. I thought Bloc might be a better option because they're entirely focused on an online self paced version of teaching their material, whereas FlatIron has both in person and online as well as full time, part time, and self paced. Also Bloc offers weekly mentorship meetings and assigns you a personal mentor who will guide you through the technical portion of the course, whereas FlatIron gives self-paced students 5 technical mentoring sessions throughout the course.

So far, I thought Bloc was better because they offered better technical support, but I realized this isn't that important for me because I kind of enjoy finding things out on my own whether it's through just googling or asking someone on my own. So I thought maybe it wasn't that bad if not maybe better to only have 5 technical mentoring sessions (where I still will be able to ask for valuable advice on important things like my projects).

One other thing that was different about Bloc and FlatIron was that Bloc accepted all students and FlatIron had an admissions process. This would mean that Bloc would have much more students that they would have to dedicate their mentors to while FlatIron would have a smaller group of more passionate and driven (according to their admissions guidelines) students to focus their efforts on. Once I got an email from my admissions counselor that I was accepted, I decided that I liked the idea that I was part of smaller group of people that FlatIron will dedicate their time to.

So in the end, I decided to go with Flatiron because 1. they are more selective and will be able to focus their limited efforts, 2. I enjoyed the way the material was taught as I got to take the prep courses, and 3. I liked having less amount of mentoring sessions and being able to learn on my own.

Hey,
I just got done with creating the OOP version of Tic Tac Toe. I am now in the GitHub section in learn. It's pretty amazing what you can do with GitHub. I love being able to make changes through command line prompt, so being able to push and pull code with simple commands was pretty cool.

I think I'm making pretty fast progress. It's mostly because I already know most of the things I'm going through right now. (Like making tic tac toe and stuff, and arrays, and methods) I'm just not really familiar with Ruby, so I'm trying to become familiar with it as I go through these lessons.

I really want to make sure I'm not just off doing my own thing so this week I want to make sure to attend a couple study groups. I don't really need any help with the lessons thus far, so I was planning on attending the coding challenges. There's one on Thursday on AI in TicTacToe and one on Sunday for I'm not exactly sure what.
