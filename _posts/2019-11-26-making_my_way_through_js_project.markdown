Hey, I think I'm around halfway? done with my JS project. 

I'm trying to create an app that will help the user understand an area in terms of real estate.
I recently got into the idea of saving up to buy real estate so I thought why not create an app for just that
There's so much research you have to do to kind of get an idea of a place.

I want to take a log of what it's been like..
It's been pretty hard trying to get everything together and bring the whole project together.
I feel like there's so many parts and features I want to add

One thing that's been helping me a lot is keeping my code very organized.
After a while, your code can just look like a bunch of gibberish. Separating code into more specific functions
has helped me comparmentalize tasks
Also just having comments helps;  I can block out different sections of the code.. And also I use it
to keep tabs on what I'm working on currently..
I think in the future, it'd probably be better to separate out all my code into different files..
Cause the JS file that I have is like one huge block of code, like some legal document.

Yeah but now I have most of the functionality.. I just need to add a couple more CRUD actions and now I can move on to adding some styling and then finally just serializing the JSON..
